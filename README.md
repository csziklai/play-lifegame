# life game

## Project Description
This personal project developed my skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Handlebars.js. Life game is a simple game based on luck and inspired 
by the board games which I loved playing as a kid. Players make the choice of going to college or starting a career, draw cards for their 
job, and roll a simulated dice to land on fun outcomes. I took a page out of some of my favorite sit-coms and romantic comedies for the 
“spaces” that a player can land on.

## Potential Improvements
Some potential future additions include using a point system to keep track of score. This proved difficult to implement with vanilla
Javascript, so perhaps using a framework such as React would be better. Having more choices in the game would also improve it so there is
more interactivity.
